Although Java offers a class that can handle file operations, that is java.io.File, it doesn’t have a copy method that will copy a file to another.  

The copying action is an important one, when your program has to handle many file related activities. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can perform a file copying operation in Java and we will discuss four of the most popular in this example.  

### 1.Copy File Using FileStreams  

This is the most classic way to copy the content of a file to another. You simply read a number of bytes from File A using `FileInputStream` and write them to File B using `FileOutputStream`.  

Here is the code of the first method:  

{%highlight java%}
private static void copyFileUsingFileStreams(File source, File dest)
		throws IOException {
	InputStream input = null;
	OutputStream output = null;
	try {
		input = new FileInputStream(source);
		output = new FileOutputStream(dest);
		byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
		int bytesRead;
		while ((bytesRead = input.read(buf)) > 0) {
			output.write(buf, 0, bytesRead);
		}
	} finally {
		input.close();
		output.close();
	}
}
{%endhighlight%}

As you can see we perform several read and write operations on big chucks of data, so this ought to be a less efficient compared to the next methods we will see.  

### 2.Copy File using `java.nio.channels.FileChannel`  

Java NIO includes a `transferFrom` method that according to the documentation is supposed to do faster copying operations than FileStreams.  

Here is the code of the second method:  

{%highlight java%}
private static void copyFileUsingFileChannels(File source, File dest)
		throws IOException {
	FileChannel inputChannel = null;
	FileChannel outputChannel = null;
	try {
		inputChannel = new FileInputStream(source).getChannel();
		outputChannel = new FileOutputStream(dest).getChannel();
		outputChannel.transferFrom(inputChannel, 0, inputChannel.size());
	} finally {
		inputChannel.close();
		outputChannel.close();
	}
}
{%endhighlight%}

### 3.Copy File using Apache Commons IO  

Apache Commons IO offers a `copyFile(File srcFile, File destFile)` method in its `FileUtils` class that can be used to copy a file to another. It’s very convenient to work with Apache Commons `FileUtils` class when you already using it to your project. Basically, this class uses Java NIO `FileChannel` internally.  

Here is the code of the third method:  

{%highlight java%}
private static void copyFileUsingApacheCommonsIO(File source, File dest)
		throws IOException {
	FileUtils.copyFile(source, dest);
}
{%endhighlight%}

### 4.Copy File using Java 7 `Files` class  

If you have some experience in Java 7 you will probably know that you can use the `copy` mehtod of the class `Files` in order to copy a file to another.  

Here is the code of the fourth method:  

{%highlight java%}
private static void copyFileUsingJava7Files(File source, File dest)
		throws IOException {
	Files.copy(source.toPath(), dest.toPath());
}
{%endhighlight%}

### Test  

Now to see which one of these methods is more efficient we will copy a large file using each one of them in a simple program. To avoid any performance speedups from caching we are going to use four different source files and four different destination files.  

Let’s take a look at the code:  

{%highlight java%}
package com.javacodegeeks.java.core;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.nio.channels.FileChannel;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;

public class CopyFilesExample {

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException,
			IOException {

		File source = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\sourcefile1.txt");
		File dest = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\destfile1.txt");

		// copy file using FileStreams
		long start = System.nanoTime();
		long end;
		copyFileUsingFileStreams(source, dest);
		System.out.println("Time taken by FileStreams Copy = "
				+ (System.nanoTime() - start));

		// copy files using java.nio.FileChannel
		source = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\sourcefile2.txt");
		dest = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\destfile2.txt");
		start = System.nanoTime();
		copyFileUsingFileChannels(source, dest);
		end = System.nanoTime();
		System.out.println("Time taken by FileChannels Copy = " + (end - start));

		// copy file using Java 7 Files class
		source = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\sourcefile3.txt");
		dest = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\destfile3.txt");
		start = System.nanoTime();
		copyFileUsingJava7Files(source, dest);
		end = System.nanoTime();
		System.out.println("Time taken by Java7 Files Copy = " + (end - start));

		// copy files using apache commons io
		source = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\sourcefile4.txt");
		dest = new File("C:\\Users\\nikos7\\Desktop\\files\\destfile4.txt");
		start = System.nanoTime();
		copyFileUsingApacheCommonsIO(source, dest);
		end = System.nanoTime();
		System.out.println("Time taken by Apache Commons IO Copy = "
				+ (end - start));

	}

	private static void copyFileUsingFileStreams(File source, File dest)
			throws IOException {
		InputStream input = null;
		OutputStream output = null;
		try {
			input = new FileInputStream(source);
			output = new FileOutputStream(dest);
			byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
			int bytesRead;
			while ((bytesRead = input.read(buf)) > 0) {
				output.write(buf, 0, bytesRead);
			}
		} finally {
			input.close();
			output.close();
		}
	}

	private static void copyFileUsingFileChannels(File source, File dest)
			throws IOException {
		FileChannel inputChannel = null;
		FileChannel outputChannel = null;
		try {
			inputChannel = new FileInputStream(source).getChannel();
			outputChannel = new FileOutputStream(dest).getChannel();
			outputChannel.transferFrom(inputChannel, 0, inputChannel.size());
		} finally {
			inputChannel.close();
			outputChannel.close();
		}
	}

	private static void copyFileUsingJava7Files(File source, File dest)
			throws IOException {
		Files.copy(source.toPath(), dest.toPath());
	}

	private static void copyFileUsingApacheCommonsIO(File source, File dest)
			throws IOException {
		FileUtils.copyFile(source, dest);
	}

}
{%endhighlight%}

### Output:  

{%highlight none%}
Time taken by FileStreams Copy = 127572360
Time taken by FileChannels Copy = 10449963
Time taken by Java7 Files Copy = 10808333
Time taken by Apache Commons IO Copy = 17971677
{%endhighlight%}

As you can see FileChannels is the best way to copy large files. If you work with even larger files you will notice a much bigger speed difference.  

This was an example that demonstrates four different ways you can copy a File in Java.
